                <p class="mb-lg-4 mb-2" style="text-align:center;">All of this means a garden that works, is beautiful,
                    uses
                    the minimum amount of water and takes less effort to maintain.
                    In short it is "done right the first time" thus saving time and money to create a Living Picture
                    that
                    you can be proud of.</p>

                    <div class="mb-lg-4 mb-2" Style="font-size:8px;color:gray;"><p>Our philosophy is to do exceptional
                            work
                            for a fair price. Our designers and workers all carry the same standard and principals. “Do
                            it
                            right the first time; structurally, aesthetically, and in a timely manner.”
                            We strive to make our work stand out giving our customer a truly custom look that is highly
                            functional.
                            We believe, it is our job to guide our customers and help them to make the right choices to
                            meet
                            their needs and budget. We want to be the answer to the problem, not part of the problem.
                            Our experience of landscape design and construction spans 28 years. Doing quality work puts
                            a
                            smile on our customer’s faces for many years to come and is our best advertisement.</p>

                        <p>The first part of designing your garden is the concept session. It can take as much as two
                            hours
                            for you to fully brief us with regard to the "look" or "feel" that you want to achieve.
                            During
                            this time we consider the spaces that you need for your lifestyle. We consider a host of
                            environmental and geographic factors that affect your garden together with a range of
                            possible
                            themes based on your preferences.
                            Finally we put these ideas to paper in the form of non-scale sketches that show you how the
                            garden will look at maturity.</p>

                            leave we will have discussed every thing, right down to where the dustbin goes! We will have
                            drawn some pictures, made a list of possible plants and discussed the correct installation
                            of
                            lawns, paving, irrigation,</p>
